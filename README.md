# Quality of Service SIG

This is an administrative repository for the Quality of Service (QoS)
SIG. It should contain documents to facilitate the group function,
e.g. meeting minutes and supporting documents. It should not contain
code nor specifications.

## Meeting Schedule

The QoS SIG holds combined meetings with the SoC Infra HC, weekly on
Wednesdays at 8am US Pacific time. We will send duplicate meeting
announcements to
[sig-qos@lists.riscv.org](https://lists.riscv.org/g/sig-qos) when QoS
is planned as a topic on the agenda for that week's SoC Infra meeting,
but it's a good idea to also subscribe to [soc-infra@lists.riscv.org
](https://lists.riscv.org/g/soc-infra).

The `minutes/` folder in this repo contains excerpts from the SoC
Infra meeting minutes, where the discussion was specifically relevant
to QoS.
