# SoC Infrastructure HC minutes 2022/06/01

 * Shared a QoS Strategy document, including a survey of literature and existing technologies
   - Requested people to review it and comment on it
   - Proposed 4 step strategy: 1) fast track privileged QID extension, 2) IOMMU QID extension, 3) QoS Register Interface (QRI) TG to develop a specification for QRI, and 4) continue QoS SIG to explore and define the strategy for additional QoS technologies.
   - Proposal is relatively standard QoS features in the industry, uncontroversial
   - Reach out to the data center and HC SIGs for feedback (may not be actively participating in SoC Infra HC, but will have an interest in the topic)
